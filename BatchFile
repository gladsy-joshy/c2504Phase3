**write a batch script to achieve the following objective

Automated Backup and Cleanup System
Objective: Create a batch file that automates the process of backing up important files from a specified directory to a backup location and then cleans up old backups.
Requirements:
Backup Files:
Copy all files from C:\TestFiles to D:\Backups\YYYYMMDD (where YYYYMMDD is the current date eg: 20241022).
Ensure the backup directory is created if it doesnâ€™t exist.
Log the Backup:
Create a log file named backup_log.txt in the backup directory.
Log the date and time of the backup and the number of files copied.
Cleanup Old Backups:
Delete backup directories older than 7 days.
